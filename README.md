# Rock Paper Scissor

## Project Name "ROCK - PAPER - SCISSOR"

<p style="background-color : red">something that should be red though</p>

This simple game website is created for completion of a project after gaining basic knowledge of JavaSript. We had to put only prompt box for user interface and show result in Console panel, which I did. I also provided little introduction for how to play this game on this website. Requirements of Project is completed, hence no need to improve UI anyfurther.

I hope you played and enjoyed the game. Looking forward for keep learning more and improving the quality of my work. Thanks for visiting!! Have a nice day ahead>>>
