### TO- TOP learners--
<p>Hellow folks, you are here it does mean that you are from TOP or just checking out repos. For my fellow TOP learners , I won't say that, this was very difficult, but at the starting it really felt difficult but once started it was just figuring out how to do the stuff we do not know about. Though we know theese projects are just for the practice purposes, but I enjoyed improving the game and adding new features to it. Which I think I will never do again because this project toook me some more days than I decided for this to complete. What the main things I learnt from the project is coding things are not that hard, we just have to figure out how to do the things. I am glad if you read this much , I will like if you can give your feedback for any improvement or about anything. 

I hope you played and enjoyed the game. Looking forward for keep learning and improving the quality of my work. Thanks for visiting!! Have a nice day ahead>>>
